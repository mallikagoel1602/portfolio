              I have been developing websites for around 1 year. Most of my

              algorithms. I have worked with HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Python,
              Django, Flask, C++ and a little bit of Tkinter.

              As engineers, we see new opportunities unfolding daily.New
              technologies emerge regularly that we need to master to succeed.
              These opportunities are wonderful, but at times they can be
              intimidating. But we should believe in life-long learning as it is
              energizing, stimulating, and yes, itâ€™s good for business.
